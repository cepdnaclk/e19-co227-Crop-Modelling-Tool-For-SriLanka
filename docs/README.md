## Introduction

 A tool to facilitate crop modelling, for plants of importance in SriLankan agriculture.

## Project Overview
CROPLANKA is a software tool designed to assist farmers and researchers in Sri Lanka with crop management decisions. It leverages historical climate data and cutting-edge technology to provide precise insights into agricultural practices.

## Key Features
Climate Data Integration: CROPLANKA incorporates historical climate data tailored to Sri Lanka's specific conditions, including temperature, rainfall, and other climate elements. This data helps users make informed decisions regarding agricultural practices, considering the dynamic climate in Sri Lanka.

Scenario Comparison: Users can compare various crop management approaches within the platform. This feature offers a visual representation of potential outcomes and risks associated with different choices, simplifying complex decision-making processes. It enables users to optimize their crop management strategies for increased productivity and resilience.

Output Visualization: CROPLANKA provides users with multiple output options, including efficient and user-friendly yield prediction visualizations. Users can view crop yield data in various graph formats (e.g., bar graphs, line charts, interactive dashboards) for easy analysis. This feature empowers users to make data-driven decisions with precision and ease.

## How to Use CROPLANKA
The guide outlines six essential steps for effectively utilizing CROPLANKA:

- Step 1: Open the CROPLANKA model.
- Step 2: Select the site or region (e.g., Anuradhapura).
- Step 3: Choose the crop (e.g., Paddy).
- Step 4: Select parameters for the scenarios, including initial water content, cultivar, sowing date, starting N, and sowing N, among others.
- Step 5: Click the "Run Model" button to initiate the analysis of your chosen scenarios.
- Step 6: Analyze the outcomes to make informed decisions about crop management.

## Process

### Ensuring Data Currency

At CROPLANKA, we understand the importance of keeping our database up-to-date with the latest scenarios and data to provide you with the most accurate and relevant insights for your crop management decisions. While updating the database with all scenarios can be a complex task, we have implemented a robust solution to ensure data currency:

### Automated Scenario Updates

Maintaining an accurate and comprehensive database is at the core of our commitment to empowering you with the best possible crop management support. We have implemented an automated scenario update system that streamlines the process and guarantees the freshness of the data you rely on.

## How It Works

Scenario Predefinition and Storage: Before scenarios are integrated into CROPLANKA, they are predefined and stored in a structured format. Each scenario includes essential parameters like initial water content, cultivar, sowing date, starting N, and sowing N, along with expected outcomes.

Automated Import: We have developed a sophisticated automated script that seamlessly imports predefined scenarios into the CROPLANKA database. This script can handle bulk imports efficiently, ensuring that the database remains comprehensive and up-to-date.

Scheduled Updates: We schedule regular updates for the CROPLANKA database, whether daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on the frequency of scenario changes. These automated updates guarantee that our tool consistently reflects the latest data and scenarios.

Data Validation: During the import process, we implement stringent data validation checks to ensure that predefined scenarios align with the tool's requirements. This safeguards data integrity and minimizes errors.

Error Handling: Robust error-handling mechanisms are in place to promptly address any issues that may arise during the import process. Errors are logged and administrators are notified, allowing for swift corrective action.

Version Control: We maintain version control for scenarios and database updates. This enables us to track changes, revert to previous versions if necessary, and ensure that you, our users, always have access to the most up-to-date information.

## User Benefits

Our commitment to automated scenario updates means you can trust CROPLANKA to deliver real-time, precise insights for your crop management decisions. This streamlined process ensures that our tool remains a reliable companion in your farming journey, adapting to evolving conditions and providing the data you need when you need it.

We value your input and feedback as we continue to improve our platform. Your success is our success, and we're dedicated to providing you with the best tools to thrive in Sri Lanka's ever-changing farming landscape.
